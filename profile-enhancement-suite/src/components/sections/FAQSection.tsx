      question: "How does the AI resume optimization work?",
      answer: "Our AI analyzes your resume using advanced natural language processing and machine learning algorithms. It evaluates factors like keyword density, ATS compatibility, formatting, content structure, and industry-specific requirements to provide personalized recommendations for improvement."

      question: "Will my resume pass ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)?",
      answer: "Yes! Our optimization specifically targets ATS compatibility. We analyze over 50 factors that ATS systems look for, including proper formatting, keyword optimization, section headers, and content structure. Most users see a 90%+ ATS compatibility score after optimization."

    },
    {
      question: "Is my resume data secure and private?",
      answer: "Absolutely. We take privacy seriously. Your resume data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. We never share your personal information with third parties, and you can delete your data at any time. Our AI processing happens securely on our servers."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the optimization process take?",

    },
